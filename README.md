# gravity-game
Multiplayer game implementing 2d gravity physics created with html canvas, javascript, and node.js.

To host, clone the repository and while in the directory run `npm install` followed by `npm start` or `node server.js`. The default hosting port is *3001*, but this can be edited in **server.js**.

Note: when a player gets destroyed, currently the only way to restart is by refreshing the page.

### Features to add:
- ~~Explain controls better.~~
- Add a way to restart after dying without refreshing page.
- Sleep server activity when no one is connected.
- Allow instancing of game.
- Maybe: Add a database to store user data.
- *Make the game fun.*
