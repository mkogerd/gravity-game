# gravity-game
Multiplayer game implementing 2d gravity physics created with html canvas, javascript, and node.js.

To host, clone the repository and while in the directory run `npm install` followed by `npm start` or `node server.js`. The default hosting port is *3000*, but this can be edited in **server.js**.

### Features to add:
- ~~Explain controls better.~~
- ~~Add a way to restart after dying without refreshing page.~~
- ~~Sleep server activity when no one is connected.~~
- Cleanup serverside code and break into node modules.
- Allow instancing of game.
- Maybe: Add a database to store user data.
- *Make the game fun.*
